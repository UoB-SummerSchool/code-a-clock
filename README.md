### Workshop Objective: Reinvent the Clock
Have fun while learning some basic programming concepts, and create a custom form of measuring or displaying time.

#### In this activity we use [Processing](https://processing.org), a Java based flexible software sketchbook.

> Processing is easy for creating visual art with a few simple lines, and is ideal for learning how to code. 

Students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists use Processing for learning and prototyping projects.  
[Visit this link](https://processing.org/exhibition/) to see some of the examples of interesting prototypes and projects.

### Setup
Although it's simple to download the processing tgz and load up the workshop,
when running large workshops it can be useful to pre-setup many accounts.

Therefore the `openday-setup.py` script can be run from any lab machine (or snowy), 
just put a `passwords.csv` file in the same folder and it will download the tgz, and scp it over to all the accounts,
along with a `.bash_profile` that automatically unzips the tgz, runs processing, and opens up the workshop in Firefox.
